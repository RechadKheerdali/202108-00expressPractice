iK

if you smell what the rock is cooking

And that is the bottom line cause Stone Cold said Stone

Rule your mind, or it will rule you

Never give up in life

Dont wait for things to happen, go out there and make things happen

Be calm, chilled and exert as little energy as you can

The less energy to give in social situation, the more you get in return, but you have to play the long game

THE END
